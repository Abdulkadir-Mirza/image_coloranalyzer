# image_coloranalyzer
Tried implementing an image color analyzer which analyzes an image provided in the code as a test input to provide us in the end with a pie chart depicting 5 colors which are present in the test data along with a representation of proportiion and comparison in form of a pie chart.
The code when run in command prompt will provide us with only the color code of the 5 colors and not a pie chart but when implemented in a jupyter or an online notebook, we get a proper pie chart representation.
